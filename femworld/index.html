        <h1>Feminicide</h1>
        <p>Feminicide, also known as femicide, is the intentional killing of women because they are women. 
        It is a hate crime rooted in gender inequality, discrimination, and violence against women.
        This term highlights the systemic nature of these killings, emphasizing that they are not 
        isolated incidents but rather a result of deeply ingrained societal issues.</p>
        <p>This webpage aims to transmit and analyze information graphically about femicide. Additionally, 
        it offers links to other websites related to this topic and bibliographic information.
        Femicide, representing the most severe form of gender-based violence against women and girls, 
        is rarely an isolated incident. It is more often the deadly consequence of systemic gender-based
        violence present in all regions worldwide. These gender-related killings of women and girls,
        occurring across private and public domains, are motivated by gender-based factors. 
        These factors are embedded in societal norms and stereotypes that deem women subordinate to men, 
        alongside discrimination, inequality, and unequal power relations between genders in society. 
        This situation is reflected in all countries, some more than others. Women experience it at 
        different ages and in different circumstances. The objective of the website is to visualize 
        the dynamics of femicide using these attributes and determine whether there is any relationship
        with poverty and the victim's educational level.</p>
        <h2>Key Aspects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gender-based violence: Feminicide is a manifestation of broader patterns of violence against women.</li>
            <li>Systemic problem: It is not simply individual acts of violence, but a societal issue.</li>
            <li>Impunity: Often, these crimes are met with impunity, further perpetuating the cycle of violence.</li>
            <li>Need for awareness and action: Raising awareness and taking action are crucial for prevention.</li>
        </ul>
